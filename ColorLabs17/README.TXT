HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: read direcctions
AUTHORS:Katie Wang
USER INSTRUCTIONS: look at the pretty pictures

 turn to grayscale

Decided to choose 6 colors. I hope that's allowed. Otherwise everything looks too melded together.



There is too much purple since both my shirt and hair is black.
At least it got the outline of my glasses

Reduced the bucket for dark colors and reduce the purple - Bavya
I tried to do the colors without looking it up. I wanted to make my neck show more. Did not work out every well.


added extra bucket (or statement) to highlight hair strands purple

adjusted emphasis on shadows on face. And a little less purple.

made the purple more muted

outlining my chin with purple made things too muted. removed bucket for that.
